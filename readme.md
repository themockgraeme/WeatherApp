# Weather App Coding Challenge

I'm going to say this upfront. There is absolutely no way that it's possible for me to complete the challenge in two and a half hours.

The requirements from the web page are:

 - Get the user's location, along with handling the use case where permission is not granted.
 - Read in a JSON file of city data, process it, and store it in a format that the app can use.
 - Use the location data to identify the nearest city to the user.
 - Access an external API, process the JSON it returns.
 - Handle the permissions settings so that a user can enable location services.
 - Display the weather data in a UI, along with having a screen for when location permissions aren't granted.

Each of the above could take a couple of hours to do if I'm starting from scratch, and not cannibalising an existing project. I could probably speed up the process by using third party libraries, such as Retrofit, but the instructions say that these are discouraged.

I started the test about a week ago and ran out of time. I've picked it up a second time, and spent between ten and fifteen hours on it. I also reused a little code from another project.

The UI is extremely basic because I need to submit the test today, and didn't feel the urge to spend more time creating something pretty.
